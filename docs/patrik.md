From Lugano, Switzerland. I spent my first 19 years there and went to school (elementare, media, and liceo); in 1990 I moved to Zurich to study Computer Science at ETH. I liked the Oberon project so much that joined the Programming Languages and Runtime Systems Research Group under Prof. J. Gutknecht, and got my Ph.D. working on the Active Oberon Project (Jaos JVM, Paco Compiler, and Active Oberon language). In 2002, I moved to the industry and worked for Elca Informatique while being also a lecturer at ETH (System-Software) and FHA (.NET). I was active in a few open-source projects (IIOP.NET, GNU Classpath, JNode). Since January 2005, I work for Google Switzerland.

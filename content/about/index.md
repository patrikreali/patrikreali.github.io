I'm a Swiss software engineer turned engineering manager with 20+ years of experience in getting innovative projects started, established, and scaled up.

I spent 20 years with Google Switzerland, 17 thereof as an engineering manager:
*   experience getting innovative (some would say crazy) projects established.
*   coaching and mentoring people.
*   experience working in highly dynamic cross-functional international environment.
*   managing up to 50 developers.

### Selected Projects and Experience

*Travel Impact Model* - Started project to add CO2 emission data to Google Flight Search from voluntary contribution and grew into a project with 20+ FTE engineers and a de-facto industry-wide standard used across the whole industry and serving 65B queries (and still counting).

*Google Shopping, Data Quality and Policy Enforcement* - Scale up operations from 3 to 50+ engineers, and 1 to 150+ manual raters. Reduce visible price error rate from 20+% to less than 2%. Roll out unified tooling across all functions (eng, support, sales) for operational management of the data, that was used by 6000+ unique internal users.

*Google, Pension Fund Committee (Personal Vorsorgekommission)* - Design of the pension fund solution for Google Switzerland, and supervision of the operations. Deep understanding of the pension and swiss social security system.

*Lecturer and Teacher* - I've always enjoyed teaching. I tought the core "operating system" lecture at ETH-Z, and introduction to C# at the Fachhoschule Nordwest, and I established the first onboarding classes for Google Zurich.
